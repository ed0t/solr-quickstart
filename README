Solr Quickstart Maven Archetype


The goal is to automate the creation of a search engine project based on Apache Solr, introducing also an optional infrastructure to execute acceptance tests.
Acceptance tests are executed with EasyB.

This project has been inspired by Relevancy Driven Development (https://github.com/rbramley/solr-rdd) by Robin Bramley and indeed the basic example story (BaseSearch.story) is part of Robin work.


-- HOW DOES IT WORKS:

* checkout the project
* mvn clean install

* mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.sourcesense.solr -DarchetypeArtifactId=solr-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=0.3-SNAPSHOT

it will create a solr project where you can modify schema.xml and solrconfig.xml

Optionally it also provides a sample acceptance test
